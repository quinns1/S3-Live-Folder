<h3>Program Operation</h3>
<br>
<hr>
<ul>
<p>
The user will begin the application by opening AWS_S3_Live_Folder.exe. This will open a Graphical User Interface where the user will be
asked to either setup a new connection or reconnect.
</p>
<h4>Setup New Connection</h4>
<p>
The user will provide the AWS AK, SAK and bucket name. They will also
decide here if they wish to sync with bucket or run application in the background (discussed below)

</p>
<p>
When the details are entered, and the user clicks connect, the connection to the AWS S3 bucket is tests. This 
is done by uploading a sample file to the bucket and deleting it again, if the connection is successful 
the users details are saved in an SQLite table located in the following location 'C:\sqlite'.
The SQLite table has the following columns
  <li>bn - Bucket Name</li>
  <li>ak - Access Key</li>
  <li>sak - Secret Access Key</li>
</p>
<p>
As every Bucket in S3 has a unique name, this is why the bucket name is used as the Primary Key. 
</p>
<p>
If the connection is not successful (the sample file fails to upload) an error message
will appear and the user will be prompted to login again.
<h4>Reconnect</h4>
<p>
The user will be able to choose from buckets already saved in the login details table 
and as before, the user will choose to 'Run in Background' and 'Sync with Bucket'
</p>
<h4>Run in Background</h4>
<p>
If ticked this option will run the program as a background process. Leaving this option
un-checked will keep the GUI open and the user will be able to close the program 
by pressing 'Stop'
</p>
<h4>Sync with Bucket</h4>
<p>
This enables multiple users to use the bucket at the same time. Files will be downloaded and
decrypted if they are encrypted and if they are not decrypted they'll be saved regardless.
