<h4>Project Overview</h4>
<p>The purpose of the project is to develop a Python program which will link a folder in a userâ€™s directory to an AWS S3 Bucket. A user will setup an account for the first time they use the program, after this all they will have to do is log in and the folder will be linked to the Cloud.
Once the setup is complete, the program will run constantly and whenever a file is created/updated in the live folder, it will be automatically uploaded to the users chosen bucket.
</p><p>
Multiple users can use the application at the same time, this is achieved by selecting the 'Sync Bucket' option on setup.
</p><p>
All files will be encrypted before being uploaded. When being downloaded (if 'Sync Bucket' option is ticked) files will be downloaded and decrypted only if they are encrypted.
