# S3-Live-Folder
Application to link local folder to S3 bucket and continuously sync (similar to OneDrive but uses AWS S3). Data is encrypted before uploading and decrypted on downloading (additional layer of security before transmitting data over network). Allows for several users to link to S3 bucket simultaneously.
